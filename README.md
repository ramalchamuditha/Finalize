<h1>Online Food Ordering App</h1>

<p>This system was carried out as part of Higher Diploma in Software Engineering which is conducted by National Institute of Business Management (NIBM). 
This program was deployed as a solution for the long queues occured on the university's resturant due to the high demand of foods and resturant was under staffed.
as mention above this application is works only on the unversity premises resturants only. Students should register to the application using thier university index number.

After registration they can view resturant's menus which updated by those resturants in different application. Students can order their meal by their choices from online

Students can order their foods in assigned time period and they will get a order id, once they got the order id they can get thier meal from the resturant without staying the queue.
